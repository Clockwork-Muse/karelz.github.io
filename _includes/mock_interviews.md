# Mock Interviews for Microsoft Developer Position

I have decided to offer a dry run / mock interviews for developer position "a la Microsoft" to community.
My [announcement](https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1081153149187117058?s=20) received some 40+ interests, so here is fullfillment of my part ...

## Personal offer, nothing Microsoft official

First and foremost, this is a personal offer.
I will do the mock interviews in my spare time, not on company time (although my work hours are flexible).
It is not part of my job.
My employer, Microsoft, does not sponsor or encourage the effort in any way known to me.

## Why me?

I am fairly experienced interviewer in Microsoft.
I like doing interviews and I conducted probably around 200 of them in last few years.
Half of them were "quick" 30 minute screenings on college campuses in US & Canada, but still interviews.

## What's in it for me?

Nothing, at least materially.
This is my way of giving back something to the community.
I do not expect any payments, compensations or endorsements for it.
The only thing I will ask you is: If you have feedback on the interview from your side, please share it with me - it will help me get better as interviewer and it will also allow me to steer the mock interview effort in a direction useful to the participants.

## Who is it for?

Primary target audience are developers who plan to interview with Microsoft in near future, but are not sure with themselves and would love to "try it out" first to understand the experience and be better prepared.
It is something I would have welcomed myself before interviewing with Microsoft in 2005.

The reasons people participate may wary - from just lowering their stress, confirming their technical knowledge, or testing their language skills (interview in English can be intimidating to many non-native speakers like me).
I wont't ask your reasons and definitely won't judge them :).

## What to expect?

First, while you can expect a reasonably seasoned interviewer to talk to you over email and eventually over Skype, please beware that I don't claim to be the best interviewer ever, or someone who knows exactly how things are.
All I am offering is my personal experience and my personal view point.

You may disagree with me and that is perfectly fine.
If I tell you my honest opinion after the mock interview, or if I recommend improvements to your resume, it does not mean I am right and I know the best.
You should view it as one view point and it is totally up to you if you want to act on my recommendations or ignore them.

Here's what I expect will happen:

1. Send to my [private email address](mailto:ZikiCZ@hotmail.com):
    * Your resume (in a structure you plan to send it to Microsoft).
        * I won't share your resume with anyone unless I get explicit permission from you.
    * Short text about what kind of developer job, or product you would like to work on (e.g. Windows, Office, Bing, Dynamics, Azure, XBox, games, UI applications, Visual Studio, compilers, frameworks, etc.).
        * If you don't know, that is fine. (I didn't have specific idea either before joining Microsoft ;))
        * Motivation: It will help me give you better feedback on your resume.
    * When you plan to interview for Microsoft.
2. I will prioritize incoming requests with these criteria:
    * Underrepresented groups in SW engineering (let me know if you're in one).
    * People with nearest interview deadlines / plans.
    * Everybody else.
3. I will provide resume feedback via email if needed (first impressions, how it matches your desired job profile, etc.)
4. I will schedule Skype mock interview with you - 1h.
    * I hope to do 1-2 mock interviews each week. People lower in the priority list may need to wait a bit for their turn.
5. We will do the mock interview.
    * I am still researching technically how - current thinking is Skype and/or mock interview site like https://www.pramp.com (I haven't tried it yet).
    * Expect me to start the mock interview the same way as in a real interview - including introduction, warm up questions, etc. The full experience.
        * Note: I always allow language of choice, pseudo-language or even mix of languages - the ideas are important, not the syntax.
    * Debrief at the end with direct and honest feedback (10 min).
        * Would I give you 'hire' or not? And why?
        * Details on what went well, what didn't go well and how it matched expectations.
        * What to improve / look for.
6. After the mock interview:
    * I will welcome direct honest feedback the other way - How did you feel during the interview? Could I do something better as interviewer? Or as part of this mock interview effort?
    * I will ask you to NOT disclose my interview question. I plan to use it for other mock interviews and wider knowledge would undermine the effort here.

## How to prepare?

I expect that you are already fully prepared for Microsoft interview.
Research resources online and/or read books about interviews in larger companies like Microsoft.
Go trough some examples.
Practice on paper.
Verify solution on computer.
Talk with your friends about it, discuss options - their pros and cons.

Check out tips from Microsoft recruiters: [How to ace a technical interview at Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/life/how-to-ace-a-technical-interview-at-microsoft).

I personally expect from candidates:

* Knowledge of basic data structures and their algorithms like working with strings, lists, binary trees, basic graph algorithms (search), basic sorting.
* Ability to understand and analyze problems, identify the right basic data structures and algorithms in them.
* Basic O-notation cost analysis of algorithms and solutions.
* Adaptability. Passion for technology, coding and solving problems. Ability to retrospect and learn from your past projects - successes and failures. Honesty with yourself and others. Desire to get better and grow (at your own pace). Being a team player.

### Book recommendation

I can recommend book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) - I read the [5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) last week (to be able to point you to useful resources ;)), and it is very spot on.

In particular, I liked these parts of the book:
* I. Interview Process - Dress Code, Top 10 Mistakes
* II. Behind the Scenes - The Microsoft Interview
* IV. Before the Interview - Getting the Right Experience, Writing a Great Resume
    * BTW: Contributing to GitHub projects, or having your own smaller project on GitHub is great way how to show your coding capabilities upfront.
* V. Behavioral Questions
* VI. Technical Questions
    * Data Structures - Really great basic questions everyone should be able to do.
    * Concepts and Algorithms - While I don't think most of these are good interview questions (some Bit Manipulation questions are rather ugly), it is worth going through them all to ensure yourself you understand basic concepts and some "known" tricks (e.g. in Brain Teasers).
    * Additional Review Problems - I didn't review them carefully, but they seem to be good things to practice on as well. I'd recommend to check them out.

### Online resource recommendation

From a quick 10-minute online research I found for example this [list of interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-for-cracking-any-coding-interview) which I liked.

I actually even found my most used interview question in the list.
It is a question I use in almost all 30-min college campus interviews, which means I used it about 80 times.
Interestingly, I haven't met a single person who knew the question upfront (I would recognize if they did and lied or didn't tell me) - I guess people do not prepare that due diligently or didn't find this site yet :).
